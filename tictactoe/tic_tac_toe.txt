In this stage your program should:

Fill the field from the input and print it as in the previous stage.
Find the state in which the game is at the moment and print it. Possible states:
"Game not finished" when no side has a three in a row but there are still empty cells;
"Draw" when no side has a three in a row and there are no empty cells left;
"X wins" when the field has three Xs in a row;
"O wins" when the field has three Os in a row;
"Impossible" when the field has three Xs in a row as well as three Os in a row. Or the field has a lot more Xs that Os or vice versa (if the difference is 2 or more, should be 1 or 0). For this stage, consider that the game can start both with X or O.
Also, you can use ' ' or '_' to print empty cells - it's up to you.
