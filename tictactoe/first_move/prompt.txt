The program should work in the following way:

Get the 3x3 field from the input as in the previous stages.
Output this 3x3 field with cells before the user's move.
Then ask the user about his next move.
Then the user should input 2 numbers that represent the coordinates of the cell which they want to mark X or O.
(9 symbols representing the field would be on the first line and these 2 numbers would be on the second line of the user input)
Analyze user input and show these messages in the following situations:
-"This cell is occupied! Choose another one!" if the cell is not empty;
-"You should enter numbers!" if the user enters other symbols instead of numbers;
-"Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!" if the user goes beyond the field.
Then output the table including the user's most recent move.
The program should also check user input. If it's unsuitable, the program should ask them to enter their coordinates once again.

So, you need to output a field from the first line of the input and then ask the user to make their move. 
Keep asking until the user enters coordinates that represent an empty cell on the field
and after that output the field with that move. 
You should output the field only 2 times, before and after a correct move.
